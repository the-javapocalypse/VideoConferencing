                    Virtual Clinic
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the early yet simpler times, patients relied only on their doctor to make house calls. The
                    impression of a General Practitioner treating a sick patient at home is now considered a quaint
                    artefact for the medical lanes as it has almost vanished. But, is it really? However, unlike all
                    conditions of the medical attention require an in-person consultation with a healthcare
                    professional, some merely do. Although, logistics or indolence may be a highlighted reason why
                    individuals are turning to Internet sites for medical opinions rather than the doctor’s office. A
                    virtual clinic is beneficial on high priority in such rural areas where doctor(s) aren’t available
                    on
                    service, functionally.

                    HR Interviews
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A millennial trend has been observed inside organizations, companies and especially HR
                    departments which are utilizing the video recordings to record job interviews or meetings with
                    employees even recording disciplinary meetings and hearings, individually. However, it is now
                    more commonplace to see companies grow their pitch using digital video. Recording job
                    interviews, performance reviews, and other meetings are almost a main course task. The
                    benefits include a vivid interview room on the software which employs a central server, acting
                    as an virtual equipment in meeting rooms as the software is able to support dozens of cameras
                    and is scalable from small one-room installations to company-wide deployments.
